Dataset: Record of Earth Meteorite Landings
Description: Contains information about location, date, name, mass, and unique id of each meteorite
Download hyperlink: https://data.nasa.gov/resource/y77d-th95.json
Import: We opened the url to retrieve data and imported as json. write_json writes the json object into meteorites.json file
